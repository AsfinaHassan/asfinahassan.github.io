### Collaborative Research Projects
- **Automated Breast Lesion Classification in Ultrasound Images**_[Ongoing]_<br>
The research aims to develop a deep learning-based model for breast cancer classification on ultrasound images, distinguishing between benign, malignant, and normal cases. This project involves validation across four public breast ultrasound datasets to improve upon current state-of-the-art models in the literature, for enhanced classification performance.<br>

### Academic Projects

- **Segmentation of Lung X-Ray Images through K-Means Clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization**<br>
Implemented K-Means clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms to segment lung cancer nodules from lung X-ray images. The segmented results were compared against existing literature to validate the accuracy of the constructed algorithms.<br>
[Details](/PDF/Imaging.pdf)

- **Simulation of Positive Feedback in the Control of Muscle Movement**<br>
Developed a simple reflex muscle control system and a non-linear muscle control system using Simulink, based on existing literature. The project involved simulating various input forces to analyze the corresponding changes in muscle length.<br>

- **Development of a Bio-Signal Filter Circuit for Electromyography (EMG) Signal Measurement**<br>
Designed and implemented a filter circuit for the measurement of electromyography (EMG) signals, tailored to meet the necessary amplitude gain, frequency bandwidth, and powerline noise removal requirements.<br>

- **Modelling and Simulating Radiofrequency Cardiac Ablation using COMSOL Multiphysics**<br>
Simulated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in myocardial tissue using a cylindrical electrode model in COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation exhibited how Joule heating could raise tissue temperatures above 50°C, for effective tumor ablation through controlled thermal damage.<br>
