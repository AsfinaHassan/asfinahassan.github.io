### Academic Projects

- **Segmentation of Lung X-Ray Images through K-Means Clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization**<br>
Implemented K-Means clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms to segment lung cancer nodules from lung X-ray images. The segmented results were compared against existing literature to validate the accuracy of the constructed algorithms.<br>
[Details](/PDF/Imaging.pdf)

- **Simulation of Positive Feedback in the Control of Muscle Movement**<br>
Developed a simple reflex muscle control system and a non-linear muscle control system using Simulink, based on existing literature. The project involved simulating various input forces to analyze the corresponding changes in muscle length.<br>
[Details](/PDF/Control.pdf)

- **Development of a Bio-Signal Filter Circuit for Electromyography (EMG) Signal Measurement**<br>
Designed and implemented a filter circuit for the measurement of electromyography (EMG) signals, tailored to meet the necessary amplitude gain, frequency bandwidth, and powerline noise removal requirements.<br>

- **Modelling and Simulating Radiofrequency Cardiac Ablation using COMSOL Multiphysics**<br>
Simulated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in myocardial tissue using a cylindrical electrode model in COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation exhibited how Joule heating could raise tissue temperatures above 50°C, for effective tumor ablation through controlled thermal damage.<br>
