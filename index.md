### Academic Projects

- **Segmentation of Lung X-Ray Images through K-Means Clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization**
Implemented K-Means clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms to segment lung cancer nodules from lung X-ray images. The segmented results were compared against existing literature to validate the accuracy of the constructed algorithms.<br>
